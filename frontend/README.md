# BuildeR

We are using [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/alert/examples) to style our component. There are lots of examples

## Extensions for development (required):
 - TSLint  (analysis tool that checks TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors)
 - EditorConfig  (helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project)
 
Some extra extensions which can significantly help to work with Angular:
- Angular Language Service (intelliSense for Angular templates)
- Angular Snippets
- Angular Schematics (working with Angular schematics via UI)

## Possible commands
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help with angular-cli

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
